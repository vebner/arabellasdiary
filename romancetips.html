        <p class="lefttext"> Want to make sure that cute guy who likes you is worth the trouble? Here's what to do. </p>
        <p class="date"> Posted: May 7, 2021 </p>
        <p class="l"> For all those women who've had a guy stare at them across a room and wondered how to take the next steps, this is for you. </p>
          <ol>
          <li><b>When he tries to get your attention in public, don't show any interest.</b> When they stare at you and
            just seem so hopelessly in love with you, it might be exciting, but don't react. Remember that
            if he really wants to be with you, he's going to have to do more than stare at you.
          </li>
          <li><b> Enlist the help of a friend.</b> This is a personal favorite of mine to use, Lucy can attest to that. If the guy seems totally
            clueless of your interest, have a friend mention it to him to nudge him in the right direction. Boys can be dumb, like Mr. Hervey was when
            I first played hard to get, but he learned, and the guy in your life will too. </li>
          <li> <b>If he tries to contact you, ignore, ignore, ignore. </b> For me, the guy was persistant. Again and again, he tried
          to get my attention by writing me cute messages, but the key is to act like you don't care about them at all. That will only
        want to woo you more when he sees you playing hard to get. The more he texts or calls, the more you know he cares.</li>
        <li><b> If things go south, stay civil. </b> If there comes a time when, inevitably, the guy disapoints you and doesn't meet
          your standards (I know none of them ever meet mine, and none could hold a torch to any of my romance novel suitors) don't
          do anything crazy, like tell him you wish he was dead. Instead, leave in good terms. I know that there was a time once when Mr. Hervey got sick, and I sent him a
          message that I hoped he got better. It might take a little more effort on your part, but it's the right thing to do. After all, you don't actually want him to die. </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="lefttext"> Learn from me, here's how to protect yourself as a woman </p>
        <p class="date"> Posted: April 29, 2021 </p>
        <p class="l"> Ladies, we all know that being a woman, especially a woman who's beautiful and alone, isn't safe when there's
          men roaming around. Case in point: the other day I was out riding and who do I see in the distance but
          Mr. Hervey, who I hadn't seen in forever. I saw him coming towards me and the worst came to mind- what if <head>
            kidnaps me, or physically harms me? Every woman has had those thoughts, and they're terrifying. You never know.
            So ladies, remember these 5 steps when you're approached by a man you think might be dangerous:
            <ol><li><b>Call for help.</b> If a man is approaching you, even if he's your ex-lover, and you think he might be dangerous,
            make it known. You don't want to wait until it's too late. When Mr. Hervey approached me, I screamed as loud as I could.
          </li><li><b>Get out of there as soon as you can.</b>Once your friends come to your rescue, distance yourself from him so they can take care of
            the situation. Don't let him talk his way out of it, stay firm. </p>
          <li><b>If that doesn't work, use protection.</b> Every lady should carry
            pepper spray or a handheld tazer. With all the men around, you never know what's going to happen. Stay safe and alert, ladies. </li>
            </ol>
         </p>

         <p class="lefttext"> How to know when he's ...not... the one </p>
         <p class="date"> Posted: April 20, 2021 </p>
         <p class="l"> Recently, my father came to me and told me he wanted to marry my cousin, Mr. Glanville, who I haven't seen
           since I was eight years old. I was totally shocked, and when I met Mr. Glanville today, he made a terrible impression.
           So, I thought I'd provide some useful commentary for my readers to answer the question, what makes a suitor wrong? Well, here's what I have to say: if he just shows up with no romantic grandure and your father already approves, he's not the one.
           At least, he wouldn't be in my romance novels. In those,
           the "one" is the man who fights for you, who wins you over despite facing disaproval. He sweeps you off your feet, winning a duel and
           making you feel like the only girl in the world. Though I know those sorts of things don't happen anymore, it's the sentiment I want:
           passion, romance, betrayal. And that's why I refuse to marry Mr. Glanville. If there's not grand romance, what's the point?
